## Dataset
This project uses New York City Yellow Taxi records for testing.
The data is publicly available at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

Note that latitude and longitude coordinates of pickups and dropoffs
are no longer recorded starting in 2016, so 2015 data was used.
